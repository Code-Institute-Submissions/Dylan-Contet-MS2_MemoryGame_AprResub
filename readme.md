# Memory Game Milestone 2 Project

## What is this Memory Game
This is a simnple memory game built to test its users memory with different icons and ranging difficulties.

## The Challenge 
Match all the cards in the least amount of time and moves.

## How to play
* Click on a card and it will reveal an icons.
* You must then try and find the card with the same icon to make a match.
* once you make a match the cards will lock into place.
* Rinse and repeat untill you have matched all the cards then move onto the next difficulty.

## How it was built
* Made a deck of cards that changes position when the page is refreshed or game is restarted.
* Made a counter to keep the players moves & timings of the current game.
* Game was made Using vanilla JS, HTML & CSS

## Testing
### All of the below were tested on my personal PC and tablet where my monitor is 1920/1080px and my tablets width is 600px
### Also all of these were tested on Chome, Firefox and Safari
* Breaking code to see how the website would react and creating errors to see if there are any bugs
* I had an issue where after 9 moves the game and timer would break this was because of an issue in JS and it not picking up more than 16 cards in the array.
* played the game multiple times and on different devices and websites.
* Had multiple people test the game with thier personal Devices.
* An error came up where the cards on the deck wouldn't fit when changing levels this was fixed by giving the cards a set size but made their positioning relative to the other cards on the deck.
